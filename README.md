# Petmety

Welcome to the Petmety repository! This project is aimed at creating a Chrome extension that brings a virtual pet to your screen. With future plans to extend support to Android devices, this project aims to be your companion across platforms.

## About

Petmety is a fun project designed to bring a touch of joy and companionship to your browsing experience. The current version features a charming cat as your virtual pet, but there are ambitious plans to expand the range of pets, skins, motions, and functionalities in the future.

## Features

- Display your virtual pet on your Chrome browser.

## Future Plans

The project is under active development, and future plans include:

- Interact with your pet by clicking, dragging, and feeding it.
- Customize your pet with different skins and motions.
- Future plans to support Android devices for on-the-go companionship.
- Adding support for more pets to choose from.
- Expanding the collection of skins and motions for existing pets.
- Implementing an edge detector so pets can walk on webpages.
- Incorporating AI to generate new skins and motions based on online videos.
- Introducing various activities for you and your pet to engage in.
- Adding sounds to enhance the immersive experience.
- Establishing a store for additional pet accessories and features.
- And many more exciting updates to come!
